    "Summary": "Current solar and geomagnetic conditions are favorable for shortwave propagation. With a Solar Flux Index of 172 and 116 sunspots, we're experiencing strong solar activity. The K-Index of 0 indicates very quiet geomagnetic conditions, which is excellent for stable propagation. The X-Ray flux at C1.9 suggests moderate solar flare activity, potentially enhancing ionization. Low signal noise (S0-S1) and calm magnetic fields (0.2) further contribute to good conditions. The solar wind speed of 332.1 km/s is moderate, not causing significant disturbances. Given the time (02:39 UTC) and location (FN05GK), nighttime propagation will dominate for the next few hours, favoring lower bands for DX, while higher bands may open towards dawn, especially for east-west paths.",
    "Low_Bands": {
        "Rating": "Excellent",
        "Explanation": "Expect exceptional conditions on 160m and 80m for the next 2-6 hours. These bands will offer strong, stable signals for both regional and DX contacts. Focus on paths to Europe, Africa, and the Middle East. CW and FT modes will be particularly effective for reaching distant stations. SSB should also perform well for closer contacts within North America and to South America."
    },
    "Medium_Bands": {
        "Rating": "Good",
        "Explanation": "40m and 30m will provide reliable propagation, especially for DX to Europe and Africa. As dawn approaches, expect improving conditions towards Asia and the Pacific. These bands will remain open for regional contacts throughout the night. CW and digital modes will be most effective for DX, while SSB can be used for closer contacts."
    },
    "Upper_Bands": {
        "Rating": "Fair",
        "Explanation": "20m, 17m, and 15m will be mostly closed for DX during nighttime hours. However, as dawn approaches (around 12:13 UTC), expect these bands to start opening, first on 20m, then progressively to 17m and 15m. Focus on east-west paths to Europe and later to Asia. FT8 might be the best mode to catch the early openings."
    },
    "High_Bands": {
        "Rating": "Poor",
        "Explanation": "12m and 10m will be closed during nighttime hours. There's a slight chance of sporadic E openings on 10m towards dawn, but this is unpredictable. These bands are best avoided for the next few hours until after sunrise."
    },
    "Magic_Band": {
        "Rating": "Poor",
        "Explanation": "6m is unlikely to offer any significant propagation during nighttime hours from your location. There's a very small chance of sporadic E, but it's not reliable. Focus on other bands for now."
